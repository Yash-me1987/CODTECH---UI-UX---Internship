## ⚠️ Initial Observations

- The layout feels outdated and visually cluttered.  
- Important actions (Search, Join, Sign In) are not clearly prioritized.  
- Excessive text in the hero section reduces clarity and focus.  
- Icons and spacing are inconsistent.  
- The onboarding flow for new users (Join vs Find a Friend) is confusing.

The redesign aims to improve:

- Visual hierarchy  
- Call-to-action clarity  
- Spacing and readability  
- Overall modern UI/UX appeal  

The redesigned version will be added in the **`final-design/`** folder.
